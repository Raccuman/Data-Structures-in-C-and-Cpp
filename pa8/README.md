Soooo, this wasnt a ton of work, but it was more than I was expecting. A lot of back tracking was the whole assignment. Instead of having regular trees we now have red black trees, which are a little bit more involved. The mainissue here was me messing up little things in psudo code. There are just so many lines to copy over it is easy to make a mistake. Also WordFrequency, that was weird. I dotn think I did it they way I should have, but the doccument page didnt have much info on it, so I did my best. Sorry if it is a little backwards. 

How to use:

Order.cpp -> just do ./Order infile.txt outfile.txt   and have your infile be a bunch of words, each on their own indivigual line. The output will be a dictionary representation of it

WordFrequency.cpp -> just dothe same thing as order, but the output will look different

Dictionary.cpp / Dictionary.h -> inside the black box, not meant for users to touch. This is were all of the dictionary functions are defined and written so Order works

DictionaryTest.cpp -> meant for my own testing purposes, no touch!

Makefile -> makes the files, in order

README.md -> a lovely little description of my code that you are reading right now.
