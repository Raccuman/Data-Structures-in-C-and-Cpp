A fun little descritpion of my program :3

Sooooo, please have mercy on me, I got my wisdom teeth out this week. Let me tell you, programming under the influence is rough buisness. It was really intimidating at first becasue I HAVE NEVER DONE C++ BEFORE. An excellent week to start am I right? So things were pretty rough starting out, but eventually I kind of got the hang of it. In terms of being introduced into a new language,  think this was very much like being thrown in the deep end. I swear Shuffle ALMOST works. At thsi point I am too tired to keep going, so I will leave it here. 

HOW TO RUN PROGRAM:
Arithmetic.cpp - just do ./Arithmetic infile outfile. The infile should have 3 lines, your first number, a newline, and then your second number. The output withh be various arithmetic expressions

BigInteger.cpp / BigInteger.h is in the black bow, it defines all of the big integer operations

List.cpp / List.h - you cant run this, its inside the black box. defines all of the functions is the List class

Makefile makes life alot easier and makes sure everything is all nice and compilled.

BigIntegerTest.cpp / ListTest.cpp is there to test some of by basic List functions. Was more meant to see if things were crashing, and gdb purposes.
